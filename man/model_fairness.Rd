\description{
This function detects bias in algorithmic decision-making
systems by computing various fairness metrics. It provides an assessment of
fairness across different groups based on the observed and predicted
outcomes. The function allows for evaluating fairness using metrics such as
demographic parity, predictive parity, predictive rate parity, accuracy
parity, false negative rate parity, false positive rate parity, true positive
rate parity, negative predicted value parity, and statistical parity and
decide whether groups are fair to a certain degree and within a certain
materiality threshold. Currently, it only supports binary classification.
}
\details{
The following fairness metrics are computed:

\itemize{
  \item{Demographic parity}{measures whether the observed variable is
    distributed equally across different groups.}
  \item{Predictive parity}{measures whether the predicted variable is
    distributed equally across different groups.}
  \item{Predictive rate parity}{measures whether the positive prediction rate
    is the same across different groups.}
  \item{Accuracy parity}{measures whether the overall accuracy is the same
    across different groups.}
  \item{False negative rate parity}{measures whether the false negative rate
    is the same across different groups.}
  \item{False positive rate parity}{measures whether the false positive rate
    is the same across different groups.}
  \item{True positive rate parity}{measures whether the true positive rate is
    the same across different groups.}
  \item{Negative predicted value parity}{measures whether the negative
    predicted value is the same across different groups.}
  \item{Statistical parity}{measures whether the predicted variable is
    distributed equally across different groups.}
