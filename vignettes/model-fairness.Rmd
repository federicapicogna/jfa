## Introduction

Welcome to the 'Algorithmic fairness' vignette of the **jfa** package. This page
provides a comprehensive example of how to use the `model_fairness()` function
in the package.

## Function: `model_fairness()`

The model_fairness() function offers methods to evaluate fairness in algorithmic
decision-making systems. It computes various model-agnostic metrics based on the
observed and predicted labels in a dataset. The fairness metrics that can be
calculated include demographic parity, proportional parity, predictive rate
parity, accuracy parity, false negative rate parity, false positive rate parity,
true positive rate parity, negative predicted value parity, and specificity
parity [@calders_2010; @chouldechova_2017; @feldman_2015; @zafar_2017;
@friedler_2019]. Furthermore, the metrics are tested for equality between
protected groups in the data.

*Practical example:*

To demonstrate the usage of the `model_fairness()` function, we will use a
renowned dataset known as COMPAS. The COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management
Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) software is a case management and decision
support tool employed by certain U.S. courts to evaluate the likelihood of a
defendant becoming a recidivist (repeat offender).

The `compas` data, which is included in the package, contains predictions made
by the COMPAS algorithm for various defendants. The data can be loaded using
`data("compas")` and includes information for each defendant, such as whether
the defendant committed a crime within two years following the court case
(`TwoYrRecidivism`), personal characteristics like gender and ethnicity, and
whether the software predicted the defendant to be a recidivist (`Predicted`).

```{r}
data("compas")
head(compas)
```

We will examine whether the COMPAS algorithm demonstrates fairness with respect
to the sensitive attribute `Ethnicity`. In this context, a positive prediction
implies that a defendant is classified as a reoffender, while a negative
prediction implies that a defendant is classified as a non-reoffender. The
fairness metrics provide insights into whether there are disparities in the
predictions of the algorithm for different ethnic groups. By calculating and
reviewing these metrics, we can determine whether the algorithm displays any
discriminatory behavior towards specific ethnic groups. If significant
disparities exist, further investigation may be necessary, and potential
modifications to the algorithm may be required to ensure fairness in its
predictions.

Before we begin, let's briefly explain the basis of all fairness metrics: the
confusion matrix. This matrix compares observed versus predicted labels,
highlighting the algorithm's prediction mistakes. The confusion matrix consists
of true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false
negatives (FN). The confusion matrix for the `African_American` group is shown
below. For instance, there are 629 individuals in this group who are incorrectly
predicted to be reoffenders, representing a false positive in this confusion
matrix.

|                           | `Predicted` = `no` | `Predicted` = `yes`   |
| ------------------------: | :----------------: | :-------------------: |
| `TwoYrRecidivism` = `no`  | 885 (`TN`)         | 629 (`FP`)            |
| `TwoYrRecidivism` = `yes` | 411 (`FN`)         | 1250 (`TP`)           |

To demonstrate the usage of the `model_fairness()` function, let's interpret the
complete set of fairness metrics for the African American, Asian, and Hispanic
groups, comparing them to the privileged group (Caucasian). For a more detailed
explanation of some of these metrics, we refer to @pessach_2022. However, it is
important to note that not all fairness measures are equally suitable for all
audit situations. The decision tree provided below (which is far from perfect)
can assist the auditor in selecting an appropriate measure for the specific
audit at hand [@buyuk_2023].

1. **Demographic parity (Statistical parity)**: Compares the number of positive
  predictions (i.e., reoffenders) between each unprivileged (i.e., ethnic) group
  and the privileged group. Note that, since demographic parity is not a
  proportion, statistical inference about its equality to the privileged group
  is not supported.

    The formula for the number of positive predictions is $P = TP + FP$, and
      the demographic parity for unprivileged group $i$ is given by
      $DP = \frac{P_{i}}{P_{privileged}}$.

    ```{r}
model_fairness(
  data = compas,
  protected = "Ethnicity",
  target = "TwoYrRecidivism",
  predictions = "Predicted",
  privileged = "Caucasian",
  positive = "yes",
  metric = "dp"
)
    ```

    ***Interpretation:***
    - *African American*: The demographic parity for African Americans compared
      to Caucasians is 2.7961, indicating that for these data there are nearly
      three times more African Americans predicted as reoffenders by the
      algorithm than Caucasians.
    - *Asian*: The demographic parity for Asians is very close to zero
      (0.0059524), indicating that there are many less Asians (4) that are
      predicted as reoffenders in these data than there are Caucasians (672).
      Naturally, this can be explained because of the lack of Asian people (31)
      in the data.
    - *Hispanic*: The demographic parity for Hispanics is 0.22173, meaning that
      there are about five times less Hispanics predicted as reoffenders in
      these data than that there are Caucasians.

2. **Proportional parity (Disparate impact)**: Compares the proportion of
  positive predictions of each unprivileged group to that in the privileged
  group. For example, in the case that a positive prediction represents a
  reoffender, proportional parity requires the proportion of predicted
  reoffenders to be similar across ethnic groups.

    The formula for the proportion of positive predictions is 
      $PP = \frac{TP + FP}{TP + FP + TN + FN}$, and the proportional parity
      for unprivileged group $i$ is given by $\frac{PP_{i}}{PP_{privileged}}$.

    ```{r}
model_fairness(
  data = compas,
  protected = "Ethnicity",
  target = "TwoYrRecidivism",
  predictions = "Predicted",
  privileged = "Caucasian",
  positive = "yes",
  metric = "pp"
)
    ```

    ***Interpretation:***
    - *African American*: The proportional parity for African Americans compared
      to Caucasians is 1.8521. This indicates that African Americans are
      approximately 1.85 times more likely to get a positive prediction than
      Caucasians. Again, this suggests potential bias in the algorithm's
      predictions against African Americans. The p-value is smaller than .05,
      indicating that the null hypothesis of proportional parity should be
      rejected [@fisher_1970].
    - *Asian*: The proportional parity for Asians is 0.4038, indicating that
      their positive prediction rate is lower than for Caucasians. This may
      suggest potential underestimation of reoffenders among Asians.
    - *Hispanic*: The proportional parity for Hispanics is 0.91609, suggesting
      that their positive prediction rate is close to the privileged group.
      This indicates relatively fair treatment of Hispanics in the algorithm's
      predictions.

    This is a good time to show the `summary()` and `plot()` functions
      associated with the `model_fairness()` function. Let's examine the
      previous function call again, but instead of printing the output to the
      console, this time we store the output in `x` and run the `summary()` and
      `plot()` functions on this object.

    ```{r, fig.align="center", fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
x <- model_fairness(
  data = compas,
  protected = "Ethnicity",
  target = "TwoYrRecidivism",
  predictions = "Predicted",
  privileged = "Caucasian",
  positive = "yes",
  metric = "pp"
)
summary(x)
plot(x, type = "estimates")
    ```

3. **Predictive rate parity (Equalized odds)**: Compares the overall positive
  prediction rates (e.g., the precision) of each unprivileged group to the
  privileged group.

    The formula for the precision is $PR = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}$, and the
      predictive rate parity for unprivileged group $i$ is given by
      $PRP = \frac{PR_{i}}{PR_{privileged}}$.

    ```{r}
model_fairness(
  data = compas,
  protected = "Ethnicity",
  target = "TwoYrRecidivism",
  predictions = "Predicted",
  privileged = "Caucasian",
  positive = "yes",
  metric = "prp"
)
    ```

    ***Interpretation:***
    - *African American*: The predictive rate parity for African Americans
      is 1.1522. This suggests that the precision for African Americans is
      approximately 1.15 times higher than for Caucasians, which indicates
      potential 'favoritism' towards African Americans in the overall positive
      predictions made by the algorithm.
    - *Asian*: The predictive rate parity for Asians is 0.86598, indicating that
      their precision is lower than for Caucasians. This suggests potential
      underestimation of reoffenders among Asians by the algorithm.
    - *Hispanic*: The predictive rate parity for Hispanics is 1.0229, suggesting
      their overall positive prediction rate is very close to that of the
      privileged group (Caucasians). This indicates relatively fair treatment in
      the algorithm's overall positive predictions.

4. **Accuracy parity**: Compares the accuracy of each unprivileged group's
  predictions with the privileged group.

    The formula for the accuracy is $A = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + FP + TN + FN}$,
      and the accuracy parity for unprivileged group $i$ is given by
      $AP = \frac{A_{i}}{A_{privileged}}$.

    ```{r}
model_fairness(
  data = compas,
  protected = "Ethnicity",
  target = "TwoYrRecidivism",
  predictions = "Predicted",
  privileged = "Caucasian",
  positive = "yes",
  metric = "ap"
)
    ```

    ***Interpretation:***
    - African American: The accuracy parity for African Americans is 1.021,
      suggesting their accuracy is very similar to the privileged group
      (Caucasians). This indicates fair treatment concerning overall accuracy.
    - *Asian*: The accuracy parity for Asians is 1.1266, suggesting their
      accuracy is slightly higher than for Caucasians, indicating potential
      favoritism in overall accuracy.
    - *Hispanic*: The accuraty parity for Hispanics is 1.0351, suggesting their
      accuracy is slightly higher than for Caucasians, indicating potential
      favoritism in overall accuracy.

5. **False negative rate parity (Treatment equality)**: Compares the false
  negative rates of each unprivileged group with the privileged group.

    The formula for the false negative rate is $FNR = \frac{FN}{TP + FN}$, and
      the false negative rate parity for unprivileged group $i$ is given by
      $FNRP = \frac{FNR_{i}}{FNR_{privileged}}$.

    ```{r}
model_fairness(
  data = compas,
  protected = "Ethnicity",
  target = "TwoYrRecidivism",
  predictions = "Predicted",
  privileged = "Caucasian",
  positive = "yes",
  metric = "fnrp"
)
    ```

    ***Interpretation:***
    - *African American*: The parity of false negative rates (FNRs) for African
      Americans compared to Caucasians is 0.46866. A value lower than 1 suggests
      that African Americans are less likely to be falsely classified as
      non-reoffenders, indicating potential bias against this group in this
      aspect.
    - *Asian*: The parity for Asians is 1.4205, indicating that they are more
      likely to be falsely classified as non-reoffenders compared to Caucasians,
      suggesting potential underestimation of reoffenders among Asians.
    - *Hispanic*: The FNR parity for Hispanics is 1.0121, indicating
      relatively similar rates as the privileged group (Caucasians), suggesting
      fair treatment in this aspect.

6. **False positive rate parity**: Compares the false positive rates (e.g., for
  non-reoffenders) of each unprivileged group with the privileged group.

    The formula for the false positive rate is $FPR = \frac{FP}{TN + FP}$, and
      the false positive rate parity for unprivileged group $i$ is given by
      $FPRP = \frac{FPR_{i}}{FPR_{privileged}}$.

    ```{r}
model_fairness(
  data = compas,
  protected = "Ethnicity",
  target = "TwoYrRecidivism",
  predictions = "Predicted",
  privileged = "Caucasian",
  positive = "yes",
  metric = "fprp"
)
    ```

    ***Interpretation:***
    - *African American*: The false positive rate parity for African
      Americans is 1.8739. This indicates that African Americans are
      approximately 1.87 times more likely to be falsely predicted as
      reoffenders than Caucasians. This suggests potential bias in the
      algorithm's false positive predictions in favor of African Americans.
    - *Asian*: The parity for Asians is 0.39222, indicating that they are less
      likely to be falsely predicted as reoffenders compared to Caucasians. This
      suggests potential fair treatment of Asians in false positive predictions.
    - *Hispanic*: The false positive rate parity for Hispanics is 0.85983,
      suggesting they are less likely to be falsely predicted as reoffenders
      compared to Caucasians. This indicates potential fair treatment of
      Hispanics in false positive predictions.

7. **True positive rate parity (Equal opportunity)**: Compares the true positive
  rates (e.g., for reoffenders) of each unprivileged group with the privileged
  group.

    The formula for the true positive rate is $TPR = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}$, and
     the true positive rate parity for unprivileged group $i$ is given by
     $TPRP = \frac{TPR_{i}}{TPR_{privileged}}$.

    ```{r}
model_fairness(
  data = compas,
  protected = "Ethnicity",
  target = "TwoYrRecidivism",
  predictions = "Predicted",
  privileged = "Caucasian",
  positive = "yes",
  metric = "tprp"
)
    ```

    ***Interpretation:***
    - *African American*: The true positive rate parity for African
      Americans is 1.5943. This indicates that African Americans are
      approximately 1.59 times more likely to be correctly predicted as
      reoffenders than Caucasians. This suggests potential favoritism towards
      African Americans in true positive predictions made by the algorithm.
    - *Asian*: The parity for Asians is 0.52964, indicating that they are less
      likely to be correctly predicted as reoffenders compared to Caucasians.
      This suggests potential underestimation of reoffenders among Asians by the
      algorithm.
    - *Hispanic:* The true positive rate parity for Hispanics is 0.98642,
      suggesting their true positive rate is very close to that of the
      privileged group (Caucasians). This indicates relatively fair treatment
      in the algorithm's true positive predictions.

8. **Negative predicted value parity**: Compares the negative predicted value
  (e.g., for non-reoffenders) of each unprivileged group with that of the
  privileged group.

    The formula for the negative predicted value is $NPV = \frac{TN}{TN + FN}$,
      and the negative predicted value parity for unprivileged group $i$ is
      given by $NPVP = \frac{NPV_{i}}{NPV_{privileged}}$.

    ```{r}
model_fairness(
  data = compas,
  protected = "Ethnicity",
  target = "TwoYrRecidivism",
  predictions = "Predicted",
  privileged = "Caucasian",
  positive = "yes",
  metric = "npvp"
)
    ```

    ***Interpretation:***
    - *African American*: The negative predicted value parity for African
      Americans is 0.98013. A value close to 1 indicates that the negative
      predicted value for African Americans is very similar to the privileged
      group (Caucasians). This suggests fair treatment in predicting
      non-reoffenders among African Americans.
    - *Asian*: The negative predicted value parity for Asians is 1.1163,
      indicating that their negative predicted value is slightly higher than for
      Caucasians. This could suggest potential favoritism towards Asians in
      predicting non-reoffenders.
    - *Hispanic*: The negative predicted value parity for Hispanics is 1.0326,
      suggesting that their negative predicted value is slightly higher than for
      Caucasians. This indicates potential favoritism towards Hispanics in
      predicting non-reoffenders.

9. **Specificity parity (True negative rate parity)**: Compares the specificity
  (true negative rate) of each unprivileged group with the privileged group.

    The formula for the specificity is $S = \frac{TN}{TN + FP}$, and the
      specificity parity for unprivileged group $i$ is given by
      $SP = \frac{S_{i}}{S_{privileged}}$.

    ```{r}
model_fairness(
  data = compas,
  protected = "Ethnicity",
  target = "TwoYrRecidivism",
  predictions = "Predicted",
  privileged = "Caucasian",
  positive = "yes",
  metric = "sp"
)
    ```

    ***Interpretation:***
    - *African American*: The specificity parity for African Americans is
      0.75105. A value lower than 1 indicates that the specificity for African
      Americans is lower than for Caucasians. This suggests potential bias in
      correctly identifying non-reoffenders among African Americans.
    - *Asian*: The specificity parity for Asians is 1.1731, indicating
      their specificity is slightly higher than for Caucasians. This could
      suggest potential favoritism in correctly identifying non-reoffenders
      among Asians.
    - *Hispanic*: The specificity parity for Hispanics is 1.0399,
      suggesting that their specificity is very close to the privileged group.
      This indicates relatively fair treatment in correctly identifying
      non-reoffenders among Hispanics.

### Bayesian Analysis

Bayesian inference, which is supported for all metrics except demographic
parity, provides credible intervals and Bayes factors for the fairness metrics
and tests [@jamil_2017]. Similar to other functions in **jfa**, a Bayesian
analysis can be conducted using a default prior by setting `prior = TRUE`. The
prior distribution in this analysis is specified on the log odds ratio and can
be modified by setting `prior = 1` (equal to `prior = TRUE`), or providing a
number greater than one that represents the prior concentration parameter (for
example, `prior = 3`). The larger the concentration parameter, the more the
prior distribution is focused around zero, implying that it assigns a higher
probability to the scenario of equal fairness metrics.

```{r}
x <- model_fairness(
  data = compas,
  protected = "Ethnicity",
  target = "TwoYrRecidivism",
  predictions = "Predicted",
  privileged = "Caucasian",
  positive = "yes",
  metric = "pp",
  prior = TRUE
)
print(x)
```

The Bayes factor $BF_{01}$, used in Bayesian inference, quantifies the evidence
supporting algorithmic fairness (i.e., equal fairness metrics across all groups)
over algorithmic bias. Conversely, $BF_{10}$ quantifies the evidence supporting
algorithmic bias over algorithmic fairness. By default, **jfa** reports
$BF_{10}$, but $BF_{01}$ = $\frac{1}{BF_{10}}$. The output above shows the
resulting Bayes factor ($BF_{01}$) in favor of rejecting the null hypothesis of
algorithmic fairness. As shown, $BF_{01}$ > 1000, indicating extreme evidence
against the hypothesis of equal fairness metrics between the groups. 

The prior and posterior distribution for the group comparisons can be
visualized by invoking `plot(..., type = "posterior")`.

```{r, fig.align="center", fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
plot(x, type = "posterior")
```

Additionally, the robustness of the Bayes factor to the choice of prior
distribution can be examined by calling `plot(..., type = "robustness")`, as
shown in the code below. Finally, the auditor has the option to conduct a
sequential analysis using `plot(..., type = "sequential")`.

```{r, fig.align="center", fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
plot(x, type = "robustness")
```
