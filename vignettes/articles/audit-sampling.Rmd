## Introduction

Welcome to the 'Audit sampling' vignette of the **jfa** package. This page
provides a straightforward guide to the functions in the package that are
designed to facilitate statistical audit sampling. Specifically, these functions
implement standard audit sampling techniques to calculate sample sizes, select
items from a population, and evaluate the misstatement in a data sample
compliant with international standards on auditing [@iaasb_2018; @aicpa_2021;
@pcaob_2020]. The package allows enables to specify a prior probability
distribution to conduct Bayesian audit sampling using these functions.

## Functions and intended usage

Below you can find an explanation of the available functions in **jfa**, sorted
by their occurrence in the standard audit sampling workflow.

- [`auditPrior()`](#creating-a-prior-distribution)
- [`planning()`](#planning-a-sample)
- [`selection()`](#selecting-a-sample)
- [`evaluation()`](#evaluating-a-sample)

### Creating a prior distribution

The `auditPrior()` function is used to specify a prior distribution for Bayesian
audit sampling. It enables formal translation of pre-existing audit information
into a prior distribution or complete customization of the prior distribution.
The function returns an object which can be used with associated `summary()` and
`plot()` methods. Objects returned by this function can also be used as input
for the `prior` argument in other functions. Additionally, these objects have a
corresponding `predict()` method to generate the predictions of the prior
distribution on the data level.

For additional details about this function, please refer to the
[function documentation](https://koenderks.github.io/jfa/reference/auditPrior.html)
on the package website.

*Example usage:*

```{r}
# Beta prior based on inherent risk (70%) and control risk (50%)
prior <- auditPrior(
  method = "arm", likelihood = "binomial",
  materiality = 0.05, ir = 0.7, cr = 0.5
)
summary(prior)
```

### Planning a sample

The `planning()` function is used to calculate a minimum sample size for audit
samples. It allows the specification of approval conditions for the sample with
respect to performance materiality or precision. The function returns an object
which can be used with associated `summary()` and `plot()` methods. To perform
Bayesian planning, the input for the `prior` argument can be an object returned
by the `auditPrior()` function, or an object returned by
`evaluation()$posterior`.

For additional details about this function, please refer to the
[function documentation](https://koenderks.github.io/jfa/reference/planning.html)
on the package website.

*Example usage:*

```{r}
# Poisson likelihood
x <- planning(materiality = 0.03, likelihood = "poisson")
# Default beta prior and binomial likelihood
x <- planning(materiality = 0.03, likelihood = "binomial", prior = TRUE)
# Custom beta prior and binomial likelihood
x <- planning(materiality = 0.03, likelihood = "binomial", prior = prior)
summary(x)
```

### Selecting a sample

The `selection()` function is used to perform statistical selection of audit
samples. It offers flexible implementations of the most common audit sampling
algorithms for attributes sampling and monetary unit sampling. The function
returns an object which can be used with associated `summary()` and `plot()`
methods. For convenience, the input for the `size` argument can be an returned
by the `planning()` function.

For additional details about this function, please refer to the
[function documentation](https://koenderks.github.io/jfa/reference/selection.html)
on the package website.

*Example usage:*

```{r}
# Fixed interval monetary unit sampling
x <- selection(
  data = BuildIt, size = 100, units = "values",
  method = "interval", values = "bookValue"
)
summary(x)
```

### Evaluating a sample

The `evaluation()` function accepts a sample or summary statistics of the sample
and performs evaluation according to the specified `method`. The function
returns an object which can be used with associated `summary()` and `plot()`
methods. To perform Bayesian evaluation, the input for the `prior` argument can
be an object returned by the `auditPrior()` function, or an object returned by
`evaluation()$posterior`.

For additional details about this function, please refer to the
[function documentation](https://koenderks.github.io/jfa/reference/evaluation.html)
on the package website.

*Example usage:*

```{r}	
# Poisson likelihood
x <- evaluation(x = 1, n = 100, method = "poisson")
# Default beta prior and binomial likelihood
x <- evaluation(x = 1, n = 100, method = "binomial", prior = TRUE)
# Custom beta prior and binomial likelihood
x <- evaluation(x = 1, n = 100, method = "binomial", prior = prior)
summary(x)
```

## Benchmarks

To ensure the accuracy of statistical results, **jfa** employs automated
[unit tests](https://github.com/koenderks/jfa/tree/development/tests/testthat)
that regularly validate the output from the package against the following
established benchmarks in the area of audit sampling:
