## Introduction

Welcome to the 'Selecting statistical audit samples' vignette of the **jfa**
package. This page outlines the most commonly used sampling methodology for
auditing and demonstrates how to select a sample using these techniques via the
`selection()` function in the package.

Auditors often need to evaluate balances or processes that involve a large
number of items or units. As it is not feasible to individually inspect all of
these items or units, they must select a subset (i.e., a sample) from the
population to make a statement about a specific characteristic (often the
misstatement) of the population. Various sampling methods, which have become
standard practice in the field of auditing, are available for this purpose
[@leslie_1979].

### Sampling units

Selecting a subset of items or units from the population requires knowledge of
the sampling units, which are physical representations of the population that
needs to be audited. Typically, the auditor must decide between two types of
sampling units: individual items in the population or individual monetary units
in the population. To conduct statistical selection, the population must be
segmented into individual sampling units, each of which can be assigned a
probability of being included in the sample. The complete collection of all
sampling units assigned a selection probability is known as the sampling frame.

#### Items

A sampling unit for record (i.e., attributes) sampling is usually a
characteristic of an item in the population. For instance, if you are inspecting
a population of receipts, a potential sampling unit for record sampling could be
the date of payment of the receipt. When a sampling unit (e.g., date of payment)
is indicated by the sampling method, the population item corresponding to the
sampled unit is included in the sample.

#### Monetary units

A sampling unit for monetary unit sampling differs from a sampling unit for
record sampling in that it is an individual monetary unit within an item or
transaction, like an individual dollar. For example, a single sampling unit
could be the 10$^{th}$ dollar from a specific receipt in the population. When a
sampling unit (e.g., individual dollar) is indicated by the sampling method, the
population item containing the sampling unit is included in the sample.

### Sampling methods

This section discusses the four sampling methods implemented in **jfa**. First,
for notation, let the the population $N$ be defined as the total set of
individual sampling units: $N = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N\}$. In statistical
sampling, every sampling unit $x_i$ in the population must receive a selection
probability $p(x_i)$.

The purpose of the sampling method is to provide a framework to assign selection
probabilities $p(x_i)$ to each of the sampling units, and subsequently draw
sampling units from the population until a set of size $n$ has been created. To
illustrate the outcomes of different sampling methods on the same data set, we
will use the `BuildIt` data set that is included in the package. This data set
can be loaded via the command below.

```{r}
data("BuildIt")
head(BuildIt)
```

#### Fixed interval sampling

Fixed interval sampling (a.k.a. systematic sampling) is a method designed to
generate representative samples from monetary populations. This algorithm
establishes a uniform interval on the sampling units. Following this, a starting
point is either manually chosen or randomly selected within the first interval.
A sampling unit is then selected at each of the uniform intervals from this
starting point throughout the population, see Figure 1.

The number of required intervals $I$ can be calculated by dividing the total
number of sampling units in the population $N$ by the desired sample size $n$:
$I$ = $\frac{N}{n}$. For example, if the total population consists of $N$ =
1000 units and the desired sample size is $n$ = 100 units, the interval would be
$I$ = 10 sampling units wide. If, subsequently, the 5$^{\text{th}}$ sampling
unit is chosen as the starting point in the first interval, the sampling units
5, 15, 25, etc., are selected to be included in the sample. It is important to
note that this selection is entirely deterministic and depends on the chosen
starting point (specified via `start`).

The fixed interval method provides a sample where each sampling unit in the
population has an equal chance of being selected. However, this method ensures
that all items in the population with a monetary value larger than the interval
width $I$ are always included in the sample, as one of these items' sampling
units will always be selected from the interval. If the population is randomly
arranged with respect to its deviation pattern, fixed interval sampling is
equivalent to random selection.

**Advantage(s):** The fixed interval sampling method is often easy to understand
and quick to execute. In monetary unit sampling, all items larger than the
calculated interval are included in the sample. In record sampling, since units
can be ranked based on value, there is a guarantee that some large items will be
included in the sample.

**Disadvantage(s):** A pattern in the population may align with the selected
interval, making the sample less representative. An additional complication with
this method is that it is difficult to extend the sample after the initial
sample has been drawn due to the possibility of selecting the same sampling
unit. However, this problem can be efficiently solved by removing the already
selected sampling units from the population and redrawing the intervals.

The code below demonstrates how to apply the fixed interval sampling method in
both a record sampling and a monetary unit sampling setting. By default, the
first sampling unit from each interval is selected. However, this can be changed
by setting the argument `start = 1` to a different value.

```{r}
# Record sampling
result <- selection(
  data = BuildIt, size = 100,
  units = "items", method = "interval", start = 1
)
head(result[["sample"]])
```

```{r}
# Monetary unit sampling
result <- selection(
  data = BuildIt, size = 100,
  units = "values", method = "interval", values = "bookValue", start = 1
)
head(result[["sample"]])
```

#### Cell sampling

The cell sampling method splits the population into the same set of intervals
$I$ used by fixed interval sampling. However, unlike fixed interval sampling, a
sampling unit is selected within each interval by randomly drawing a number
between 1 and the interval range $I$. This results in a variable space $i$
between the sampling units, as shown in Figure 2.

<center>

![Figure 2: Illustration of cell sampling](cellSampling.png)

</center>

This method ensures that all items in the population with a monetary value
larger than twice the interval $I$ are always included in the sample, as one of
these items' sampling units will always be selected from one of the two
intervals.

**Advantage(s):**  Unlike fixed interval sampling, which has a systematic
interval $i$ to determine selections, cell sampling allows for more possible
sets of samples. It is argued that the cell sampling algorithm addresses the
pattern problem found in fixed interval sampling.

**Disadvantage(s):** Cell sampling has a drawback in that not all items in the
population with a monetary value larger than the interval are always included in
the sample. Additionally, population items can be located in two adjacent
intervals, creating the possibility of an item being included in the sample
twice.

The code below demonstrates how to apply the cell sampling method in both a
record sampling and a monetary unit sampling setting. Since this algorithm
involves random number generation, it is important to set a seed via
`set.seed()` to ensure the results are reproducible.

```{r}
# Record sampling
set.seed(1)
result <- selection(
  data = BuildIt, size = 100,
  units = "items", method = "cell"
)
head(result[["sample"]])
```

```{r}
# Monetary unit sampling
set.seed(1)
result <- selection(
  data = BuildIt, size = 100,
  units = "values", method = "cell", values = "bookValue"
)
head(result[["sample"]])
```

#### Random sampling

Random sampling is the simplest and most straightforward selection method. This
method allows every sampling unit in the population an equal chance of being
selected, meaning that every combination of sampling units has the same
probability of being selected as every other combination of the same number of
sampling units. In essence, the algorithm draws a random selection of size $n$
from the sampling units, as illustrated in Figure 3.

**Advantage(s):** The random sampling method produces an optimal random
selection, with the added benefit that the sample can be easily extended by
reapplying the same method.

**Disadvantages:** Since the selection probabilities are equal for all sampling
units, there is no guarantee that items in the population with a large monetary
value will be included in the sample.

The code below demonstrates how to apply the random sampling method (with or
without replacement using `replace`) in both a record sampling and a monetary
unit sampling setting. Since this algorithm involves random number generation,
it is important to set a seed via `set.seed()` to ensure the results are
reproducible.

```{r}
# Record sampling
set.seed(1)
result <- selection(
  data = BuildIt, size = 100,
  units = "items", method = "random"
)
head(result[["sample"]])
```

```{r}
# Monetary unit sampling
set.seed(1)
result <- selection(
  data = BuildIt, size = 100,
  units = "values", method = "random", values = "bookValue"
)
head(result[["sample"]])
```

#### Modified sieve sampling

The fourth and final sampling method option is modified sieve sampling
[@hoogduin_2010]. This algorithm begins by selecting a standard uniform random
number $R_i$ between 0 and 1 for each item in the population. Then, the sieve
ratio $S_i$ = $\frac{Y_i}{R_i}$ is calculated for each item by dividing the
book value of the item by the random number. Finally, the items in the
population are sorted by their sieve ratio $S_i$ in descending order, and the
top $n$ items are chosen to be included in the sample. Unlike the classical
sieve sampling method [@rietveld_1978], the modified sieve sampling method
allows for precise control over sample sizes.

The code below demonstrates how to apply the modified sieve sampling method in a
monetary unit sampling setting. Since this algorithm involves random number
generation, it is important to set a seed via `set.seed()` to ensure the results
are reproducible. Also note that since this algorithm requires the book values
of the items, it is not possible to apply in a record sampling setting.

```{r}
# Monetary unit sampling
set.seed(1)
result <- selection(
  data = BuildIt, size = 100,
  units = "values", method = "sieve", values = "bookValue"
)
head(result[["sample"]])
```

### Ordering or randomizing the population

The `selection()` function offers additional arguments (`order`, `decreasing`,
and `randomize`) that enable you to preprocess your population before selection.
The `order` argument takes the name of a column in `data` as input, and the
function then sorts the population based on this column. The `decreasing`
argument specifies whether the population is sorted from lowest to highest (when
`decreasing = FALSE`) or from highest to lowest (when `decreasing = TRUE`).

For instance, if you wish to sort the population from the lowest to the highest
book value (found in the `bookValue` column) before starting monetary unit
sampling, you should use `order = "bookValue"` along with the
`decreasing = FALSE` argument.

```{r}
set.seed(1)
result <- selection(
  data = BuildIt, size = 100,
  units = "values", values = "bookValue",
  order = "bookValue", decreasing = FALSE
)
head(result[["sample"]])
```

In addition, the `randomize = TRUE` argument can be used to randomly shuffle the
items in the population before selection. By default, no randomization is
applied.

```{r}
set.seed(1)
result <- selection(
  data = BuildIt, size = 100,
  units = "values", values = "bookValue", randomize = TRUE
)
head(result[["sample"]])
```
