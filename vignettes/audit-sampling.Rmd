## Introduction

Welcome to the 'Audit sampling' vignette of the **jfa** package. Here you can
find a detailed explanation of the functions in the package that facilitate the
statistical audit sampling workflow. Specifically, these functions implement
standard audit sampling techniques to calculate sample sizes, select items from
a population, and evaluate misstatement in a data sample. The **jfa** package
enables users to create a prior probability distribution to perform Bayesian
audit sampling using these functions. For more detailed explanations of each
function, read the other vignettes on the
[package website](https://koenderks.github.io/jfa/articles/index.html).

## Functions and intended usage

Below you can find an explanation of the available functions in **jfa**, sorted
by their occurrence in the standard audit sampling workflow.

### Creating a prior distribution

The `auditPrior()` function is used to specify a prior distribution for Bayesian
audit sampling. The interface allows a complete customization of the prior
distribution as well as a formal translation of pre-existing audit information
into a prior distribution. The function returns an object of class `jfaPrior`
which can be used with associated `summary()` and `plot()` methods. Objects with
class `jfaPrior` can also be used as input for the `prior` argument in other
functions. Moreover, `jfaPrior` objects have a corresponding `predict()`
function to produce the predictions of the prior distribution on the data level.

For more information about this function, see the
[function documentation](https://koenderks.github.io/jfa/reference/auditPrior.html)
on the package website.

*Example usage:*

```{r}
# Beta prior based on inherent risk (70%) and control risk (50%)
prior <- auditPrior(method = "arm", likelihood = "binomial",
                    materiality = 0.05, ir = 0.7, cr = 0.5)
summary(prior)
```

### Planning a sample

The `planning()` function is used to calculate a minimum sample size for audit
samples. It allows specification of statistical requirements for the sample with
respect to the performance materiality or the precision. The function returns an
object of class `jfaPlanning` which can be used with associated `summary()` and
`plot()` methods. To perform Bayesian planning, the input for the `prior`
argument can be an object of class `jfaPrior` as returned by the `auditPrior()`
function, or an object of class `jfaPosterior` as returned by the `evaluation()`
function.

For more information about this function, see the
[function documentation](https://koenderks.github.io/jfa/reference/planning.html)
on the package website.

*Example usage:*

```{r}
# Poisson likelihood
x <- planning(materiality = 0.03, likelihood = "poisson")
# Default beta prior and binomial likelihood
x <- planning(materiality = 0.03, likelihood = "binomial", prior = TRUE)
# Custom beta prior and binomial likelihood
x <- planning(materiality = 0.03, likelihood = "binomial", prior = prior)
summary(x)
```

### Selecting a sample

The `selection()` function is used to perform statistical selection of audit
samples. It offers flexible implementations of the most common audit sampling
algorithms for attributes sampling and monetary unit sampling. The function
returns an object of class `jfaSelection` which can be used with associated
`summary()` and `plot()` methods. The input for the `size` argument can be an
object of class `jfaPlanning` as returned by the `planning()` function.

For more information about this function, see the
[function documentation](https://koenderks.github.io/jfa/reference/selection.html)
on the package website.

*Example usage:*

```{r}
# Fixed interval monetary unit sampling
x <- selection(
  data = BuildIt, size = 100, units = "values",
  method = "interval", values = "bookValue"
)
summary(x)
```

### Evaluating a sample

The `evaluation()` function takes a sample or summary statistics of the sample
and performs evaluation according to the specified method and sampling
objectives. The function returns an object of class `jfaEvalution` which can
be used with associated `summary()` and `plot()` methods. To perform Bayesian
evaluation, the input for the `prior` argument can be an object of class
`jfaPrior` as returned by the `auditPrior()` function, or an object of class
`jfaPosterior` as returned by the `evaluation()` function.

For more information about this function, see the
[function documentation](https://koenderks.github.io/jfa/reference/evaluation.html)
on the package website.

*Example usage:*

```{r}	
# Poisson likelihood
x <- evaluation(x = 1, n = 100, method = "poisson")
# Default beta prior and binomial likelihood
x <- evaluation(x = 1, n = 100, method = "binomial", prior = TRUE)
# Custom beta prior and binomial likelihood
x <- evaluation(x = 1, n = 100, method = "binomial", prior = prior)
summary(x)
```
