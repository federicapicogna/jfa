## Introduction

Welcome to the 'Data auditing' vignette of the **jfa** package. This page
provides a straightforward guide to the functions in the package that are
designed to facilitate data auditing. Specifically, these functions implement
techniques to test the distribution of (leading or last) digits against a
reference distribution (e.g., Benford's law), and techniques to assess whether
values are repeated more frequently than expected. The package enables users to
specify a prior probability distribution to perform Bayesian data auditing with
these functions.

## Functions and intended usage

Below you can find an explanation of the available data auditing functions in
**jfa**.

- [`digit_test()`](#testing-digit-distributions)
- [`repeated_test()`](#testing-for-repeated-values)

### Testing digit distributions

The `digit_test()` function accepts a vector of numeric values, extracts the
requested digits, and compares the frequencies of these digits to a reference
distribution. By default, the function performs a frequentist hypothesis test of
the null hypothesis that the digits are distributed according to the reference
distribution, and produces a *p*-value. When a prior is specified, the function
performs a Bayesian hypothesis test of the null hypothesis that the digits are
distributed according to the reference distribution against the alternative
hypothesis that the digits are not distributed according to the reference
distribution, and produces a Bayes factor [@kass_1995]. The function returns an
object that can be used with the associated `summary()` and `plot()` methods.

For additional details about this function, please refer to the
[function documentation](https://koenderks.github.io/jfa/reference/digit_test.html)
on the package website.

*Example usage:*

```{r}
# Compare first digits to Benford's law
digit_test(sinoForest[["value"]], check = "first", reference = "benford")
```

### Testing for repeated values

The `repeated_test()` function analyzes the frequency with which values are
repeated within a set of numbers. Unlike Benford's law, and its generalizations,
this approach examines the entire number at once, not only the first or last
digit. For the technical details of this procedure, see [@simonsohn_2019]. The
function returns an object that can be used with the associated `summary()` and
`plot()` methods.

For additional details about this function, please refer to the
[function documentation](https://koenderks.github.io/jfa/reference/repeated_test.html)
on the package website.

*Example usage:*

```{r}
# Inspect last two digits for repeated values
repeated_test(sanitizer[["value"]], check = "lasttwo", samples = 5000)
```

## Benchmarks

To ensure the accuracy of statistical results, **jfa** employs automated
[unit tests](https://github.com/koenderks/jfa/tree/development/tests/testthat)
that regularly validate the output from the package against the following
established benchmarks in the area of data auditing:

- [benford.analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/package=benford.analysis) (R package version 0.1.5)
- [BenfordTests](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BenfordTests) (R package version 1.2.0)
- [BeyondBenford](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BeyondBenford) (R package version 1.4)
